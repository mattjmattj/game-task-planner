# Game task planner

## Rationale

A tool for planning the various tasks that need to be done during each basketball game,
or whatever event you want to plan. The main goal of the app is to generate a planning that lowers
the amount of work for each person involved.

## Big warning

This application is mainly an excuse for teaching TDD, so don't expect me to provide
any kind of support whatsoever :) : there is no roadmap, no backlog, no nothing. I'm
not even sure that it will work at some point.

## TDD

Some commits are marked `#tdd`. They should not have been commited but, for teaching purposes,
I decided to commit between every TDD moment, with the idea of expliciting my though process
while designing the application.
